      Development: Pet-Shop

      <b>Goal and Value of Pet-Shop</b>
      <div>
        The goal of this project was to implement a react-app that showed off knowledge of how to use JavaScript,
        HTML, and CSS together. This project was valuable because I not only got to learn and use JavaScript
        for the first time, but with JavaScript I developed incorporated complex functions like filter and sort
        for my pet-shop options. This project furthered my knowledge on how to use layout a web page or app with
        the use of dynamic grids. Putting it simply, now I understand that JS is the backend, and HTML is the front end,
        and CSS controls the layout in web programming.

      <b>Usability Principles</b>
      <div>
        I considered all the usability principles in mind while designing this page (usability, learnability,
        memorability, and efficiency). Pet-Shop is a very simple page to understand, use, and use again. 
        The nav-bar at the top deals with the sort and filter options, while the pet options are clearly visible
        with an add to cart option.
